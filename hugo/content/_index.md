# Embedded C for Arm Cortex-M Microcontrollers

This reference manual is intended to help programmers of Arm Cortex-M based microcontrollers to master their devices. It is a reference for the C language, the most widely used language for embedded microcontrollers.

This reference manual explains the underlying concepts of the C language and shows the Arm related specifics. For example, being a 32-bit architecture, access to memory is different than for the good old 8051.

The labs are using [Arm Keil MDK](https://www2.keil.com/mdk5), the integrated development environment (IDE) from Arm for microcontrollers. The free MDK-Lite edition is sufficient to follow the examples that are part of this manual. To download and install the tool, just follow the [instructions on keil.com](http://www2.keil.com/mdk5/install/). For most labs, no access to hardware is required, as the labs run in the ÂµVision simulator. For working with real hardware, there is plenty of third party material available, just take a look at the link list at the end of the manual.

I hope that you find this reference manual useful in your daily work. Happy coding!
