# Expressions and statements

Every C program is made using statements. The program is executed statement by statement. Every statement is made using one or more expressions. An expression is a sequence of [operators](../operators) and their operands that specifies a computation.

In other words, an expression is an instruction that is executed and returns a value (even when this value is `void`). A statement is used to form the sequence of a program.
