# Storage classes

Storage classes describe the features of a variable/function. These features basically include the scope, visibility and lifetime. They are used to trace the existence of a certain variable during the runtime of a program.

*Scope* refers to where in a program a variable may be accessed. *Lifetime* refers to how long a variable will exist or retain its value.
