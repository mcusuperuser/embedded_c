### Chapter 12

# Pointers

Many books will teach you that a pointer points to something, but this is not true:

A pointer is a variable that contains the memory address of another variable.

### Where are pointers used?

Pointers provide a method to pass more than one piece of information into and out of a function (remember that a function can only return one value). They also provide means to pass arguments by reference to [functions](./andfunctions), rather than by value. And finally, pointers are more efficient when accessing [arrays](./andarrays) and dealing with [strings](./andstrings).
