C provides various data types. Normally, you would use:

- `int` for most variables and things that you can count, such as loop counts, events, and apples
- `char` for characters and strings
- `float` for measurable things that require decimal numbers, such as distance, temperature, or voltage
- `uint32_t` for bit manipulations, especially on 32-bit registers
- The appropriate `<stdint.h>`/`<arm_math.h>` types for storing and working with data explicitly meeting your needs (for example if you require that an integer has exactly N bits)

### Size and alignment of basic data types in Arm C/C++
