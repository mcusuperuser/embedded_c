A variable is a kind of bucket that you can use to hold program data.

Variable declarations consist of a **data type** and a unique **identifier (name)**.

**Code example**
```c
int myVar;
myVar = 42;
```

The data type determines the size of the memory location that is used to store the variable and determines how the value of the variable is interpreted.

**Code example**
```c
int   myVar;
char  myLetter;
float myFLoat,
```
