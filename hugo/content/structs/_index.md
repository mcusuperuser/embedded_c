# Structures

Arrays are named collections of identical objects. **Structures** are named collections of different objects. Variables within a structure are referred to as *members*, and may be accessed individually as needed.

Structures:

- may contain any number of members. These members may be of any data type.
- allow a group of related variables to be treated as a single unit, even if different types are contained.
- organize complicated data more easily.
