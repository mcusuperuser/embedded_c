This lab shows how to declare and use constants and how to use the printf()
function to print messages on the Debug printf() Viewer window in µVision.

The example runs in simulation on an Arn Cortex-M3 device. It is fully CMSIS
compliant.

- Build the project
- Start a debug session (F5)
- Observe the output on the Debug printf() Viewer window
- Check the value of the variables in the Watch1 window
