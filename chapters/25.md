# Operators

What is an operator?

> An arithmetic expression contains one or more operands and arithmetic operators.

Operands may be variables, constants or functions that return a value.

## Arithmetic operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic/mathematical operations on operands. Arithmetic operators are of two distinct types: 
- Binary Operators work on two operands: +, -, *, /, %
- Unary Operators work on a single operand: +, -, ++, --

| Operator | Operation | Example | Result |
|:----------:|-----------|:---------:|--------|
| * | Multiplication | `x * y` | Product of `x` and `y` |
| / | Division | `x / y` | Quotient of `x` and `y` |
| % | Modulo | `x % y` | Remainder of `x` divided by `y` |
| + | Addition | x + y | Sum of `x` and `y` |
| - | Subtraction | `x - y` | Difference of `x` and `y` |
| - | (unary) Negative | `-x` | Negative value of `x`|
| + | (unary) Positive | `+x` | Value of `x` |

### Division operator

If both operands are of an integer type, the result will be an interger type as well (valid for `int` and `char`).
