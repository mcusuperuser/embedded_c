# Pointers

What is a pointer?

Many books will teach you that a pointer points to something, but this is not true:

> A pointer is a variable that contains a memory address.

As any other variable, you need to declare a pointer. Furthermore, you have to initilialize a pointer before you can use it.

## Pointer declaration

You declare a pointer just like any other variable:

`type *name;`

- `type` can be any C type (such as `char`, `int`, or `float` for example).
- `name` is the name of the pointer variable.
- The `*` makes the variable a pointer.

**Code example**
```c
int *myPointer        // declares a pointer named myPointer as an integer type
float *myOtherPointer // declares a pointer named myOtherPointer as a float type

myPointer = &myIntVar;        // assigns the memory address of myIntVar to myPointer
myOtherPointer = &myFloatVar; // assigns the memory address of myFloatVar to myOtherPointer
```
