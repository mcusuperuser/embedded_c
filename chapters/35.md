# Decision making

## Boolean expressions

C (unlike C++) does not have a boolean data type. As shown in the table in chapter [Data types](#data-types), you can use `_Bool` for that. But the usual convention is that any boolean expression returns integer values:
- `0` if an expression evaluates as `FALSE`
- non-zero if it evaluates as `TRUE` (usually `1`, but this is not guaranteed)

**Code example**
```c
int main (void) {
    int a = 3, b, c;
    c = (a > 2); // c = 1 (TRUE)
    b = (a < 1); // b = 0 (FALSE)
}
```

### Express it differently

Expressions can be written in different ways which all lead to the same result (are evaluated similarly). Laziness drives programmers to usually use the first method of the following example:

**Code example**
```c
#define BUTTONPRESSED 1

int main (void) {
    if (BUTTONPRESSED)
      // do something
    if (BUTTONPRESSED != 0)
      // do something else
}
```

## `if` statement

**Syntax**
```c
if (expression) statement
```

The expression is evaluated in a boolean fashion. If it is true, the statement is executed.

*Note*

The `statement` can also be a compound/block statement.

**Code example**
```c
#define BUTTONPRESSED 1

int main (void) {
    if (BUTTONPRESSED) {
        printf("Button is pressed\n");
    }
}
```

### `if (a)` vs. `if (a == 1)`

Not only laziness commands the usage of `if (a)`. This C code will also lead to reduced assembly code size, as it only has to test for not being equal to `0`:

```
0x00001170 4807      LDR      r0,[pc,#28]  ; @0x00001190
0x00001172 6800      LDR      r0,[r0,#0x00]
0x00001174 B110      CBZ      r0,0x0000117C
```

`if (a == 1)` creates more assembly code, as it has to explicitly check the equality with `1`:

```
0x0000117C 4808      LDR      r0,[pc,#32]  ; @0x000011A0
0x0000117E 6800      LDR      r0,[r0,#0x00]
0x00001180 2801      CMP      r0,#0x01
0x00001182 D102      BNE      0x0000118A
```

*Note*

- `CBZ` is the "compare and branch on zero" instruction that will only branch if the comparison with `0` is TRUE.
- There is no "compare and branch on one" instruction, so you have to compare first (`CMP`) and then branch (`BNE`) if the result is not equal one.

### Nesting `if` statements

You can nest `if` statements easily.

**Code example**
```c
#define BUTTONPRESSED 1

int main (void) {
    if (BUTTONPRESSED) {
        printf("Button is pressed\n");
    }
}
```
